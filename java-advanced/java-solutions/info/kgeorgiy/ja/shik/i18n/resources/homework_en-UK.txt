Homework assignment 13. Text statistics
Create a TextStatistics application that analyzes texts in different languages.
Command line arguments: text locale, output locale, text file, report file.
Supported text locales: all locales available in the system.
Supported output locales: Russian and English.
The files are UTF-8 encoded.
Statistics should be calculated in the following categories: sentences, words, numbers, money, dates.
The following statistics should be collected for each category: number of occurrences, number of different values, minimum value, maximum value, minimum length, maximum length, average value/length.
Sample report:
File to analyze "input.txt"
Summary statistics
Number of offers: 43.
Number of words: 275.
Number of numbers: 40.
Number of amounts: 3.
Number of dates: 3.
Sentence statistics
Number of sentences: 43 (43 different).
Minimum sentence: "Command line arguments: text locale, output locale, text file, report file.".
Maximum sentence: "Number of numbers: 40.".
Minimum sentence length: 13 ("Number of dates: 3.").
Maximum sentence length: 211 ("GK: if you put a real sentence here, the process will not converge").
Average sentence length: 55.465.
Statistics by words
Number of words: 275 (157 different).
Minimum word: "GK".
Maximum word: "languages".
Minimum word length: 1 ("c").
Maximum word length: 14 ("TextStatistics").
Average word length: 6.72.
Statistics by numbers
Number of numbers: 40 (24 different).
Minimum number: -12345.0.
Maximum number: 12345.67.
Average number: 207.676.
Statistics on amounts of money
Number of sums: 3 (3 different).
Minimum amount: 100.00 ₽.
Maximum amount: 345.67 ₽.
Average amount: 222.83 ₽.
Statistics by date
Number of dates: 3 (3 different).
Minimum date: May 22, 2021.
Maximum date: June 8, 2021.
Average date: May 30, 2021.
You can count on the entire text being stored in memory.
When completing the task, you should pay attention to:
Decomposition of messages for localization
Matching messages by gender and number
Write tests that test the above behavior of the application.
To implement the tests, we recommend using JUnit (Tutorial). Many usage examples can be found in the tests.
If you are familiar with another test framework (for example, TestNG), you can use it.
You can't use self-written frameworks and tests that run through main.
